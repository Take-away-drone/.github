## Features

- Autonomous Flight: The drone should be capable of autonomous flight, meaning it can operate without constant human control. It should be able to navigate and detect trash in its surroundings.
- AI-Enabled Object Detection: The drone's AI system should be trained to recognize different types of trash items, such as plastic bottles, cans, paper, etc. It should use computer vision algorithms to identify and locate trash accurately.
- Real-time Monitoring: The drone's system should provide real-time monitoring and feedback on the trash detection process. It can display the detected objects or send data to a central monitoring station.
- recision Navigation: The drone should have precise navigation capabilities to hover, move, and position itself accurately for trash detection and collection. It may use GPS, sensors, or other technologies to achieve this.
- Trash Collection Mechanism: The drone should be equipped with a mechanism, such as a robotic arm or gripper, to pick up the detected trash. This mechanism should be capable of securely gripping different types of objects.
- Environmental Sensors: The drone may have additional sensors to detect environmental factors, such as air quality, temperature, or humidity. These sensors can provide valuable data for analysis and monitoring purposes.
- Communication and Connectivity: The drone should have communication capabilities to transmit data, receive commands, and provide updates to a central control system or operators. This can be achieved through wireless technologies like Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
